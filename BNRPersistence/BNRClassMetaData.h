 @discussion The information necessary for the store to get objects into and out
 of the backend.  In particular, each object going into the store needs a unique rowID (or
 or primary key). The rowIDs are unique for that class.  The version number is
 there so that in readContentFromBuffer: an object can figure out what version the
 data was written in.  The classID is written to the stream when you need to know which
 class is in the store.

 rowIDs will start at 2 because the database doesn't allow record 0 and record 1 contains
 this class meta data.

 BNRClassMetaData are kept in a BNRClassDictionary, so they don't actually have the 
 Class itself.
